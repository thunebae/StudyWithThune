### Framework: Python with PyQt5-tools

### Idea
It's application just for demo (without communication through internet). For the purpose of preventing scores from leaking at server, we use AES-128 mode CBC to encrypt the data of the database and the AES key will be encrypted and exchanged by ECC.

### Implement
{{< img src="/images/project/ecc/graph.png" title="HÃ¬nh 1" caption="UEIIS project graph" alt="UEIIS project graph" >}}

- When a teacher or student logs in, the public key will be downloaded from the server and use for decrypting ciphertext to score table.

- When the teacher adds, deletes, edits grades, the program will automatically generate a new key pair including private-key and public-key respectively to encrypt the edited data.

- Ciphertext stored on the server makes it easy for the server to encrypt or decrypt the transcript data (encrypted with AES) after verifying the user's identity with the private-key.
