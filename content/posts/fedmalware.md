### Federated learning
It is decentralized machine learning, where the server sends the initialization model to the clients, then the client uses the global model to train with their own data and then their local model onto the server. The server will aggregate these local models using the aggregation algorithm.

### In my project

- ***Model***: using MLP 2-layer (115,2) algorithm for training model

- ***Aggregation algorithm at server***: FedAVG (recipe below)

- ***Dataset***: NBaIoT dataset from 9 IoT devices contains data of 2 labels (benign, attack). I split dataset to 40 clients, each client has 10000 data, ratio of benign data and attack data is random (so, it's is IID dataset).

### Result

After running federated learning 40 rounds, the result is below.
