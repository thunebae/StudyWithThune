### Framework: Django with python 
### Idea: 
Create a website to manage F0 patient at home (This project  was created when my team must study at home because of Social distancing during covid epidemic)
### Feature:
{{% alert theme="warning" %}}**:warning:WARNING:** CarePlus has many bugs, omissions, incomplete functions. But my team has too lazy to fix and complete it {{% /alert %}}

- **For all users**: sign in, log out, edit profile (edit picture profile), health declaration

- **Only for doctor**: add patient by identity card number (it's only show in patient profile and only doctor knows it), classify patient (warning level: blue (it's fine. Patient can be take care at home), yellow, red(they must let patient go to hospital emergently)), symptom monitoring online by updates of patient or patient's relative and write prescriptions for specific patients.

- **Only for patient**: symptom update, edit medical records (background disease, date of illness, place of travel), view today's prescription
